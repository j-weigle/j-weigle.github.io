            <h1>Fibonacci Sphere</h1>
            <p>This is a sphere built from a set of Fermat's, or parabolic, spirals.</p>
            <p>If you evenly space each point of n points generated sequentially across
              a third axis, from -1 to 1, it creates a very evenly spaced set of points
              on a sphere.</p>
            <p>If you watch the sphere for a while, you will notice some points that are
              near each other, so it is not perfect by any means.</p>

            <h1>Fibonacci Disk</h1>
            <p>This is a disk built from a set of parabolic spirals. They are just not
              distributed across a third axis like the sphere.</p>
            <p>With n points, this is generated by incrementing from 0 to n and multiplying
              by the golden angle at each index to get theta.</p>
            <p>The radii can be generated from any constant scalar. The radius growth rate
              of this example is the index divided by n, which gives a unit circle.</p>
            <p>Lastly, x and y coordinates are generated by simple trigonometry. That is,
              cosine(theta) is x and sine(theta) is y.</p>

            <h1>GOLDEN ANGLE</h1>
            <p>The golden angle is an angle derived from the golden ratio. The golden ratio
              is when two quantities have a ratio to one another that is the same as the
              ratio of the larger of the two to the sum of both. That is; if a &lt; b then
              a / b &equiv; b / (a + b)</p>
            <p>This idea applied to the circumference of a circle results in the golden
              angle, or approximately 137.508 degrees (2.39996 radians).</p>
            <p>The example here has an n of <span id="ga-count">0</span> and shows how
              each point is added sequentially, with each index being 137.508 degrees
              away from the last.</p>

          <div class="inner-section">
            <h1>SUNFLOWER</h1>
            <p>Drawn with lines instead of dots, this pattern looks remarkably similar to a
              sunflower.  This would be due to the fact that the golden angle plays a large
              roll in botany.</p>
            <p>Phyllotaxy is the term used to describe the arrangement of leaves on a plant
              stem. Disk phyllotaxis with same-size elements often have a mesh that occurs
              as Fermat spirals.</p>
            <p>And this all relates back to Fibonacci through the golden ratio. If you pick
              any two consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, as n increases they
              approach the golden ratio where n is the nth number in the sequence.</p>
