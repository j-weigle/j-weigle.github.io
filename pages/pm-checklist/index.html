            PM Checklist Generator is an Android application developed in Java. The goal of this project was to allow forklift
            companies that still use paper preventative maintenance checklists to easily change to an all digital solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are 4 activities to the app: Main, Checklist, Info Fields, and File Browser. The main activity is where the
            user can choose to start an electric or combustion checklist, or browse previously generated files. The checklist
            activity is a set of radio buttons that have to all be checked before going to the info fields. The info fields
            then allows input of customer, employee, and truck specific information.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pdf output is done using the native Android PrintedPdfDocument API. Storage is kept local to the application, so
            it was necessary to write a file browser. Attempting to open the initial containing folder involves sending its URI to
            an external application, and that isn't allowed for security reasons. It could have been bypassed by using FileProvider
            in order to convert to a content:// URI instead of a file:// URI, but results were inconsistent across devices/android
            versions.
