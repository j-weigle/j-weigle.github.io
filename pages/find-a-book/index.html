            Find A Book is a web application written in React.js and uses the Google Books API.
            The project was initialized using create-react-app. Results are retrieved using the javascript fetch method.
            CSS was generated using SCSS via dart-sass.
          </p>
          <p>
            Special features include a loading animation and custom pagination.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the interesting parts about building this project was the totalItems JSON field returned by the Books API.
            Initially it was assumed to be accurate. But the higher the startIndex that was sent to the API, the lower the totalItems
            value grew. Therefore, while the custom pagination originally created a link to the final page, the finalized version does
            not assume that there are any pages beyond the first.
